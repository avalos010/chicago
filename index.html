      <p> The Chicago River is 156 miles long (251 km) and goes through the city of Chicago, Illinois, including the center of the city (the Chicago Loop). The river is not long, but it is known for being the reason why Chicago became an important place, as the connection between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Valley waterways. The river is the only river in the world to be reversed (which is, made to flow backwards, in the opposite of its natural direction) by civil engineering.</p>

      <p> Standing tall above every other skyscraper in Chicago, Willis Tower (formerly known as the Sears Tower) is a 110-story building in the heart of downtown. One of the tallest buildings in the world and the tallest building in America, it is impossible to miss when appreciating the skyline.The Willis Tower was the first building to use Khan's bundled tube structure. This innovative design was structurally efficient and economic: at 1,450 feet, it provided more space and rose higher than the Empire State Building</p>
